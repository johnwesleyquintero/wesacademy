# Codebase Analysis and Modernization Suggestions

## Unimplemented Features and Placeholder Functions

This section details unimplemented features or placeholder functions identified in the codebase:

1.  **Static Data Usage**: The `HomePage.tsx` and `CoursesPage.tsx` currently rely on static data imported from <mcfile name="courseData.ts" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\data\courseData.ts"></mcfile> (e.g., `featuredCourses`, `trendingCourses`, `categories`). While the application is connected to Supabase and the <mcsymbol name="useCourses" filename="useCourses.ts" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\hooks\useCourses.ts" startline="50" type="function"></mcsymbol> hook exists to fetch dynamic course data, it is not being utilized in these primary display pages. This is a significant unimplemented feature, as the application is not yet fully data-driven from its backend.
2.  **"Watch Demo" Button Functionality**: The "Watch Demo" button in the Hero Section of <mcfile name="HomePage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\HomePage.tsx"></mcfile> currently lacks concrete functionality. It appears to be a placeholder.
3.  **Course Filtering Integration**: The <mcsymbol name="CourseFilters" filename="CourseFilters.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\components\courses\CourseFilters.tsx" startline="1" type="class"></mcsymbol> component is imported in <mcfile name="CoursesPage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\CoursesPage.tsx"></mcfile>, but its full integration with dynamic filtering of Supabase data is not apparent. The current filtering logic operates on the static `featuredCourses` array.
4.  **Stats Section Data**: The data displayed in the <mcsymbol name="StatsSection" filename="StatsSection.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\components\home\StatsSection.tsx" startline="1" type="class"></mcsymbol> component on the home page might also be static. Further investigation is needed to confirm if this data is fetched dynamically or hardcoded.
5.  **Course Player Mock Data**: The <mcfile name="CoursePlayer.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\CoursePlayer.tsx"></mcfile> component uses hardcoded mock data for `course`, `currentLesson`, `curriculum`, `resources`, and `notes`. This needs to be replaced with dynamic data fetched from Supabase, likely using the `id` from `useParams` to fetch specific course and lesson details.
6.  **Incomplete Course Details in Player**: The `CoursePlayer` component currently displays a generic video and mock lesson information. It needs to be fully integrated with the course data from Supabase, including the actual video URLs, lesson content, and curriculum structure.
7.  **Missing Course Review Submission**: While <mcfile name="CourseDetailPage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\CourseDetailPage.tsx"></mcfile> displays course reviews, there doesn't appear to be a mechanism for users to submit new reviews.

## Modernization Suggestions

This section provides recommendations for modernizing the codebase to enhance performance, maintainability, and security:

1.  **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Replace all static data imports in <mcfile name="HomePage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\HomePage.tsx"></mcfile> and <mcfile name="CoursesPage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\CoursesPage.tsx"></mcfile> with dynamic data fetched using the <mcsymbol name="useCourses" filename="useCourses.ts" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\hooks\useCourses.ts" startline="50" type="function"></mcsymbol> hook. This will make the application truly data-driven and scalable.
2.  **Enhanced State Management for Filters**: When integrating dynamic data, ensure robust and efficient state management for search terms and filters in <mcfile name="CoursesPage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\CoursesPage.tsx"></mcfile>. Consider using a state management library if the complexity grows, or React's `useReducer` for more complex local state.
3.  **Comprehensive Error Handling and Loading States**: Fully utilize the `loading` and `error` states provided by the <mcsymbol name="useCourses" filename="useCourses.ts" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\hooks\useCourses.ts" startline="50" type="function"></mcsymbol> and <mcsymbol name="useEnrollments" filename="useEnrollments.ts" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\hooks\useEnrollments.ts" startline="24" type="function"></mcsymbol> hooks to provide clear user feedback during data fetching. Implement skeleton loaders or spinners for loading states and informative error messages for failed requests.
4.  **Image Optimization**: Investigate and implement image optimization strategies for course images. Instead of directly serving large images, consider using a CDN with image transformation capabilities (e.g., Cloudinary, Imgix) or Supabase's storage features with image resizing to serve optimized, responsive images (e.g., WebP format) to improve page load times.
5.  **Pagination/Infinite Scroll**: For the <mcfile name="CoursesPage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\CoursesPage.tsx"></mcfile>, implement pagination or infinite scrolling to efficiently load and display a large number of courses, preventing performance degradation and improving user experience.
6.  **Server-Side Search Integration**: Integrate the `searchCourses` function from <mcsymbol name="useCourses" filename="useCourses.ts" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\hooks\useCourses.ts" startline="50" type="function"></mcsymbol> into <mcfile name="CoursesPage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\CoursesPage.tsx"></mcfile> to perform server-side searches, leveraging Supabase's query capabilities for more accurate and efficient search results.
7.  **Supabase Realtime for Dynamic Updates**: For features that could benefit from live updates (e.g., new course enrollments, real-time chat in a course player, live notifications), explore and integrate Supabase's real-time subscriptions to provide a more dynamic and engaging user experience.
8.  **TypeScript Strictness and Best Practices**: Conduct a thorough review of TypeScript usage. Ensure strict type checking is enabled and address any implicit `any` types. Define more precise types for API responses and component props to enhance code maintainability and reduce runtime errors.
9.  **Refactor `AuthContext`**: The <mcsymbol name="AuthContext" filename="AuthContext.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\contexts\AuthContext.tsx" startline="4" type="class"></mcsymbol> is quite large. Consider splitting it into smaller, more focused hooks or contexts if its responsibilities grow further (e.g., separate contexts for user profile, authentication actions).
10. **Consistent Icon Usage**: The `CategoryCard` component in <mcfile name="HomePage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\HomePage.tsx"></mcfile> uses conditional rendering for icons based on string names. While functional, a more scalable approach might involve mapping icon names to actual Lucide React components or using a dedicated icon component to centralize icon rendering logic.
11. **Dynamic Course Player Content**: Implement logic in <mcfile name="CoursePlayer.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\CoursePlayer.tsx"></mcfile> to fetch course and lesson data dynamically from Supabase based on the `courseId` and `lessonId` (if applicable) from the URL parameters. This includes video URLs, lesson titles, descriptions, and curriculum structure.
12. **User Progress Tracking**: Enhance the `useEnrollments` hook to not only track enrollment but also detailed user progress within a course, including completed lessons and overall course completion percentage. This data should be persisted in Supabase.
13. **Review Submission Feature**: Implement a form or component in <mcfile name="CourseDetailPage.tsx" path="c:\Users\johnw\wesacademy\src\pages\CourseDetailPage.tsx"></mcfile> that allows authenticated users to submit ratings and written reviews for courses.
